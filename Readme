Description:

My project is a website that would provided access to news stories and useful information.
By focusing on positive and empowering stories as well as usefull information I think this website could make a diference for people in the community.
By incorporating third party APIS, displaying the stories on the fornt end and piecing together all of the logic with the back end I get to showcase what I've learned while
at Launch Academy.
